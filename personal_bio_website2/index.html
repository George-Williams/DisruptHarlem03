	<h1>Two Sides of the Same Coin</h1>
	<h3>This website brings to light something many fans of DC and Marvel may not have noticed, and that is that actor Ryan Reynolds plays both The Green Lantern from DC comics, as well as Deadpool from Marvel comics.</h3>
	<h3>He plays both roles spectacularly though, so there is no reason for us to be distraught over his dual sidedness.
