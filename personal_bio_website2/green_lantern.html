	<h3> Hal Jordan, played by Ryan Reynolds, was the son of an air force pilot, until his father died in an airplane accident. Hal inherits the green power ring from a previous Green Lantern who crashed on Earth, and inherited the Green Lantern power. The key to becoming a powerful Green Latntern is to "show no fear", a trait that even as a kid Hal insisted on portraying.</h3>
