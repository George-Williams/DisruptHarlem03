	<h3>Wade Wilson was an average man living a normal life until he was diagnosed with cancer. Not wanting his life to end, he went to a mysterios group who promised him super powers to cure his cancer. He gained super regeneration by being subjected to insanely intense tests and experiments, with the side affect being it completely ruined his face. He decided not to return to his girlfriend, and he ran away from home to become Deadpool, a paid mercernary.</h3>
	<h3>Deadpool often makes vulgar jokes, and tends to break the 4th wall, however, the most notable in the movie is when they begin testsing, and tell him he will become a superhero, he asks that as long as it isn't in a green suit, a jab at Ryan Reynolds previos role as Green Lantern </h3>
